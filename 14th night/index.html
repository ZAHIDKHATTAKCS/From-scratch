<!-- we can't link scss files in the html main page because we have to transfile it first because browser can't read it out -->
<!-- In the scss file we can also write the normal code of the css and also we can write the code for scss. because the scss is the subset of the css & we can't write the scss code in the normal css file -->
<!-- For transfile of scss we should use an extension of vscode which is sass compiler which creates always to extra files of style.css and styles.css.map -->
